**Effective Date: November 16, 2025**

Welcome to Glitch Text Generator (hereinafter referred to as "the Website" or "we"). We take your privacy protection very seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information.

## 1. Information Collection Overview

### 1.1 Information We Do NOT Collect

**The Website commits to:**

- ❌ **Not storing any text content you input**: All content you enter into the text generator is processed locally in your browser only and is never uploaded to our servers
- ❌ **Not requiring registration or login**: You can use all features without creating an account
- ❌ **Not collecting personal identification information**: We do not collect your name, email, phone number, or other personal information
- ❌ **Not using Cookies to store personal data**: We do not store any personally identifiable information through Cookies

### 1.2 Anonymous Data We Collect

To improve service quality and user experience, we collect the following anonymous statistical information through third-party analytics tools:

**Collected via Google Analytics:**

- Page views and browsing paths
- Device types used (desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.)
- Browser type and version
- Operating system information
- Geographic location (country/region and city level)
- Traffic sources (search engines, direct access, external links, etc.)
- Time spent on pages
- Generator types used (Zalgo, Cursed, Flip, etc.)

**Collected via Microsoft Clarity:**

- Anonymous session replays (for analyzing user interaction patterns)
- Heatmap data (clicks, scrolling behavior)
- Page performance metrics
- JavaScript error logs

**Important Note:** All this data is anonymous and not linked to your personal identity. We cannot identify specific individual users through this data.

## 2. Data Processing Methods

### 2.1 Local Processing

All text conversion functions are completed locally in your browser:

- **Unicode character conversion**: Implemented using pure frontend JavaScript, no server involvement required
- **Real-time preview**: All preview effects are rendered on the client side
- **Text copying**: Copy function uses the browser's native clipboard API

**Technical implementation:**

- Uses `unicode-text-decorator` library for mathematical alphanumeric symbol conversion
- Uses `confusables` library for character obfuscation
- Custom character mapping dictionaries for special effects (Zalgo, Cursed, Glitch, etc.)

This means your text content never leaves your device; we cannot see or store anything you input.

### 2.2 No Server Storage

The Website is deployed on Cloudflare using Static Site Generation (SSG):

- The website consists of pre-rendered static HTML pages
