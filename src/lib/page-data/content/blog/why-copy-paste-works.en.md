You may have noticed that there are many "text generators" online, but most of the "text" they generate is actually images that cannot be copied and pasted at all. However, the glitch text generated by our generator can be **copied and pasted directly** anywhere like plain text. Why is this? This article will delve into the technical principles behind it.

## Key Difference: Plain Text vs Images

First, let's clarify a core concept: **Truly copy-pasteable text must be in plain text format**.

### ❌ Non-Copy-Pasteable "Text"

Many so-called "text generators" actually generate:

**1. Image Format**

```
┌─────────────┐
│  PNG/JPG    │  ← This is not text, it's an image
│  Looks like │
│    text     │
└─────────────┘
```

- Drawn using Canvas or SVG
- Exported as image files
- Can only be saved or inserted, cannot copy as text
- Cannot be indexed by search engines
- Cannot be used in plain text environments

**2. CSS Style Effects**

```html
<span style="filter: blur(2px);">Glitch effect</span>
```

- Depends on HTML and CSS rendering
- Disappears outside webpage environment
- Cannot paste to Discord, games and other non-webpage environments
- Only plain text when copied

**3. Special Font Files**

```
Needs to install CoolFont.ttf to display
```

- Needs to install font files on device
- Won't display on another computer
- Cannot use cross-platform
- Recipient must also install same font

### ✅ Copy-Pasteable Text

Our glitch text generator uses:

**Pure Unicode Text**

```
Z̴a̴l̴g̴o̴ T̴e̴x̴t̴  ← This is real text!
```

- Plain text format, same as regular text
- Can be copied and pasted directly
- Cross-platform, cross-application compatible
- Permanently effective, won't fail
- Can be searched, indexed, edited

## Unicode: Technical Foundation for Copy-Paste

### What is Unicode?

**Unicode (Universal Code)** is an international standard character set designed to unify encoding for all writing systems in the world.

**Key data**:

- Contains over **149,000 characters**
- Covers **159 writing systems**
- Supports **all modern languages**
- Supported by all modern operating systems and applications

**Significance of Unicode**:
Before Unicode appeared, different countries and regions used different character encodings (such as GBK, Shift-JIS, ISO-8859, etc.), causing chaotic cross-platform text display. Unicode unified encoding for all characters, making the same text display correctly anywhere in the world.

### How Does Unicode Achieve Cross-Platform Compatibility?

Unicode's power lies in it being an **international standard**:

**1. Operating System Level Support**

- Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- All modern operating systems have built-in Unicode support
- System-level text rendering engines

**2. Application Level Support**

- Browsers, text editors, chat software
- Games, social media, office software
- Almost all modern applications support Unicode

**3. Network Transmission Level Support**

- UTF-8 becomes internet standard encoding
- Emails, messages, webpages all use UTF-8
- Lossless transmission, no garbled text

**4. Storage Level Support**

- Databases, file systems all support Unicode
- Can be permanently saved
- Cross-device sync won't have problems

## Unicode Implementation Principles of Glitch Text

### Combining Characters

This is the core technology for implementing Zalgo and other glitch text.

**What are Combining Characters?**

Combining characters are a special class of Unicode characters that don't display alone, but "attach" above, below, left and right of the previous character.

**Unicode ranges**:

- U+0300 to U+036F: Combining Diacritical Marks
- U+1AB0 to U+1AFF: Combining Diacritical Marks Extended
- U+1DC0 to U+1DFF: Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement
- U+20D0 to U+20FF: Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols

**Example**:

Base character: `H` (U+0048)

Add one combining character:

```
H + ̃ (U+0303, combining tilde) = H̃
```

Add multiple combining characters:

```
H + ̃ + ̂ + ̄ + ̆ = H̃̂̄̆
```

Continue stacking:

```
H + (multiple upper combining) + (multiple lower combining) = H̴̡̢̧̛̗̺͙̦̮̳
```

**Key points**:

- These are **legal Unicode character combinations**
- All modern systems can process correctly
- When copying, base character and all combining characters copied together
- After pasting, receiving system automatically renders same effect

### Character Variants

Unicode includes not only regular Latin letters, but also numerous character variants.

**Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols**

- U+1D400 to U+1D7FF
- Includes bold, italic, script, Fraktur and other variants

**Example**:

Regular letters: `Hello`

- H (U+0048), e (U+0065), l (U+006C), l (U+006C), o (U+006F)

Fraktur: `𝕳𝖊𝖑𝖑𝖔`

- 𝕳 (U+1D587), 𝖊 (U+1D58A), 𝖑 (U+1D595), 𝖑 (U+1D595), 𝖔 (U+1D598)

Script: `𝓗𝓮𝓵𝓵𝓸`

- 𝓗 (U+1D4D7), 𝓮 (U+1D4EE), 𝓵 (U+1D4F5), 𝓵 (U+1D4F5), 𝓸 (U+1D4F8)

Bold: `𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗼`

- 𝗛 (U+1D5DB), 𝗲 (U+1D5F2), 𝗹 (U+1D5F9), 𝗹 (U+1D5F9), 𝗼 (U+1D5FC)

**Why can these be copied and pasted?**
Because they are all independent Unicode characters, no essential difference from regular letters A, B, C, just different appearance.

### Rotated and Flipped Characters

Some language characters look like rotated or flipped English letters.

**Example**:

Normal: `hello`
Flipped: `ɥǝןןo`

Used characters:

- ɥ (U+0265) - Latin Small Letter Turned H
- ǝ (U+01DD) - Latin Small Letter Turned E
- l (U+006C) - Regular lowercase letter l
- o (U+006F) - Regular lowercase letter o

These characters come from:

- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
- African language alphabets
- Other minority language writing systems

Although their original purpose is not to represent flipped English letters, visually they can achieve this effect.

### Enclosed and Boxed Characters

Unicode contains various decorative letter and number variants.

**Example**:

Circle font: `Ⓗⓔⓛⓛⓞ`

- Ⓗ (U+24BD), ⓔ (U+24D4), ⓛ (U+24DB), ⓛ (U+24DB), ⓞ (U+24DE)

Square font: `🄷🄴🄻🄻🄾`

- 🄷 (U+1F137), 🄴 (U+1F134), 🄻 (U+1F13B), 🄻 (U+1F13B), 🄾 (U+1F13E)

Solid circle font: `🅗🅔🅛🅛🅞`

- 🅗 (U+1F157), 🅔 (U+1F154), 🅛 (U+1F15B), 🅛 (U+1F15B), 🅞 (U+1F15E)

These are all Unicode predefined characters specifically for various typesetting and decorative needs.

## Why Other Solutions Cannot Copy-Paste?

### Solution 1: Canvas/SVG Image Generation

**Working principle**:

```javascript
// Draw "text" using Canvas
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.font = '30px Arial';
ctx.fillText('Glitch Text', 10, 50);
// Export as image
const image = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
```

**Why can't copy-paste?**

- Output is **image data**, not text data
- Operating system clipboard doesn't recognize this as "text"
- Even if copied, can only copy image file, not text

**Limitations**:

- Cannot use in plain text environments (like Discord chat)
- Cannot be indexed by search engines
- Large file size, slow loading
- Cannot edit or modify

### Solution 2: CSS Style Effects

**Working principle**:

```html
<style>
	.glitch {
		text-shadow:
			2px 2px red,
			-2px -2px blue;
		animation: glitch 1s infinite;
	}
</style>
<span class="glitch">Glitch Text</span>
```

**Why can't copy-paste?**

- Style effects are **rendered** by browser
- Actual text content is still plain text
- Only copies plain text from HTML source when copying
- Style information stored in CSS, won't be copied

**Limitations**:

- Only works in webpage environment
- Cannot use in Discord, games, social media and other non-webpage environments
- Fails on another website
- Needs additional CSS code support

### Solution 3: Custom Font Files

**Working principle**:

```css
@font-face {
	font-family: 'GlitchFont';
	src: url('glitch-font.ttf');
}
.glitch-text {
	font-family: 'GlitchFont';
}
```

**Why can't copy-paste?**

- Font only changes character **display appearance**
- Actually stores regular Unicode characters (A, B, C)
- After copy-paste, recipient doesn't have same font installed
- Text falls back to system default font display

**Limitations**:

- Needs to install font on each device
- Mobile devices usually cannot install custom fonts
- Different operating systems have different font formats
- Cannot use cross-platform

## Advantages of Unicode Solution

### 1. True Text Format

Glitch text generated by Unicode is **true text**:

```
Plain text data:
Z̴a̴l̴g̴o̴ = [U+005A, U+0334, U+0061, U+0334, U+006C, U+0334, ...]
```

- Stored as text data
- Takes minimal space (about 2-4 bytes per character)
- Can be edited like plain text
- Can be found by text search

### 2. Universal Compatibility

Unicode is an international standard with global support:

**Operating Systems**:

- ✅ Windows 7 and above
- ✅ macOS 10.4 and above
- ✅ Linux (all modern distributions)
- ✅ iOS 2.0 and above
- ✅ Android 1.0 and above

**Applications**:

- ✅ All mainstream browsers
- ✅ Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp and other chat software
- ✅ Word, Pages, Google Docs and other document editors
- ✅ Photoshop, Illustrator and other design software
- ✅ Roblox, Minecraft and other games

**Network Services**:

- ✅ All social media platforms
- ✅ Email systems
- ✅ Cloud storage services
- ✅ Online collaboration tools

### 3. Permanently Effective

Once generated, permanently effective:

**Reasons won't fail**:

- Unicode standard is backward compatible
- Assigned characters won't be deleted or changed
- System updates won't affect display
- Doesn't depend on any third-party services

**Real cases**:

- Zalgo text generated in 2010 still displays perfectly in 2025
- Copied from Windows to Mac, effect consistent
- Saved to file, still correct after 10 years

### 4. Zero Dependencies

Doesn't need any additional resources:

- ❌ No need to install fonts
- ❌ No need for internet connection
- ❌ No need for special software
- ❌ No need for plugins or extensions
- ✅ Only needs Unicode-supporting environment (now almost all environments support)

### 5. Lightweight and Efficient

Text data extremely small:

**Comparison**:

```
Image method:
"Hello" → hello.png (about 5-50 KB)

Unicode method:
"Ḧ̴e̴l̴l̴o̴" → about 15 bytes
```

- Images can be **thousands of times larger** than Unicode
- Fast loading
- Saves traffic
- Saves storage space

### 6. Searchable and Indexable

Search engines and apps can index:

```
Regular search: Search "Zalgo"
Can find: Z̴a̴l̴g̴o̴ (Unicode text)
Cannot find: [Image: Zalgo] (Image format)
```

- Benefits SEO
- Can be found by in-app search functions
- Can be processed by text analysis tools

### 7. Editable

Can be edited like plain text:

```
Original: H̴e̴l̴l̴o̴
Modified: H̴e̴l̴l̴o̴ W̴o̴r̴l̴d̴ ← Add text
Delete: H̴e̴l̴o̴ ← Delete one l
```

- Supports copy, cut, paste
- Supports find, replace
- Supports spell check (for base characters)

## Technical Implementation Details

### How Does Our Generator Work?

**Step 1: Receive Input Text**

```javascript
Input: Hello;
```

**Step 2: Analyze Each Character**

```javascript
Split: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'];
```

**Step 3: Add Combining Characters to Each Character**

```javascript
For Zalgo effect:
H → H + [random upper combining] + [random lower combining]
  → H̴̡̢ (H + U+0334 + U+0321 + U+0322)
```

**Step 4: Control Intensity**

```javascript
Low intensity: 1-3 combining characters
Medium intensity: 4-7 combining characters
High intensity: 8-15 combining characters
```

**Step 5: Assemble Output**

```javascript
Result: H̴̡̢e̴͎̺l̴̗̝l̴̝̫o̴̰̖;
```
