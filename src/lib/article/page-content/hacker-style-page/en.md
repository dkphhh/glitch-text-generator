## What is an ASCII Text Generator?

An **ascii text generator** (often based on the legendary **FIGlet** program) is a tool that converts normal text into large, decorative banners using standard ASCII characters. **ASCII art** is a graphic design technique that dates back to the 1960s, using the 95 printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard to create pictures and typography.

In the early days of computing, printers lacked graphics capabilities. To create banners or mark divisions between print jobs, operators used **ASCII banner generator** software to print large letters made of smaller characters. Today, this style is synonymous with hacker culture, retro computing, and the "Matrix" aesthetic.
