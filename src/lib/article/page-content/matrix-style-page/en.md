## A Brief History of ASCII Art

**ASCII art** is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963.

Historically, ASCII art was invented because early printers often lacked graphics ability. Characters were used in place of graphic marks. Today, it has evolved into a digital art form used in:
- **Email signatures:** In the early days of the internet, images couldn't be embedded in emails, so people used ASCII art.
- **BBS (Bulletin Board Systems):** The precursor to modern forums relied heavily on ASCII for visual flair.
- **Warez NFO files:** The underground software scene famously used complex ASCII art in their release notes.

Our tool is based on **FIGlet**, a computer program that generates text banners in a variety of typefaces. The name derives from "Frank, Ian and Glenn's letters". It is a standard utility on many Unix-like operating systems and has been ported to the web so you can use it right here in your browser.
