# Discord ASCII Art Generator: The Ultimate Guide to Cool Text Banners

Whether you want to create a massive **ASCII banner generator** style header or just some **cool ASCII art** to impress your friends, our tool has you covered.

## What is an ASCII Text Generator?

An **ASCII text generator** is a tool that converts normal text into larger, decorative text made up of ASCII characters (letters, numbers, and symbols). This style of digital art dates back to the early days of computing, specifically the 1960s, when printers lacked graphics capabilities. Today, it's a popular aesthetic in gaming communities, coding forums, and especially on Discord.

Our tool functions as a **Text to ASCII art generator**, taking your input and transforming it into elaborate **ASCII letters** using various "fonts" or styles. These styles are often based on the classic **FIGlet** program, which generates text banners in a variety of typefaces.
