Our glitch text generator works based on the **Unicode character set**. Unicode contains over 140,000 characters, including:

- **Combining characters**: Special symbols that can attach above and below base characters
- **Decorative characters**: Letter variants with special styles
- **Symbol characters**: Various decorative symbols and marks

Through intelligent algorithms, we combine these Unicode characters to create stunning visual effects. Because we use standard Unicode characters, the generated text can display and copy-paste normally on any platform that supports Unicode.
